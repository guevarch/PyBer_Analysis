# PyBer_Analysis
Overview
  - The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type, creating a summary data frame comprising of total drivers,  total fares, total riders,  average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Lastly, draw a comparison of multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.
Results
  - Using the data cleaning and grouping skills learned in this module, a summary data was produced using the following data points: Index of city types, columns of total drivers, rides, fares, and average fare per ride and per driver.

  - To proceed further with the analysis, the time must be converted to a datetimeindex vs float value.

  - In addition, the data was filtered between two dates.

  - The data needed to be resampled into a weekly timeframe and plotted using multiple line chart graph. From the data, urban had the highest fares per month, suburban came in seconnd and rural came last.

Summary
  - The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type, creating a summary data frame comprising of total drivers,  total fares, total riders,  average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Lastly, draw a comparison of multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. Using techniques we learned in this module such as merge, groupby, resample, pivot, reset, and datetime formatting, we were able to clean, filter, merge and segregate the data. From the analysis, the most profitable city type was urban, followed by suburban and rural. Possible suggestions would be to increase promotional material for ride sharing and increase drivers in urban and suburban cities.
